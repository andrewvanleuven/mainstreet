Notes:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Taxable sales measure the reported sales of goods and services that are subject to the statewide retail sales tax.  Because many retail transactions are exempt or otherwise excluded from the state sales tax, the values reported here do not capture all retail activity occurring within a given locality.   ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Per capita sales values were derived by dividing total taxable sales by estimated population for each locality.  Population data were based on U.S. Census Bureau and Iowa State University estimates.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Values reported in this table have been adjusted for inflation using the Implicit Price Deflator for Personal Consumption Expenditures published by the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Annual totals for FY2009 and later reflect a fiscal year beginning on July 1st.  Annual totals prior to FY2009 reflect a fiscal year beginning on April 1st. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
